My Vim settings, mostly mostly used for python/django + html & js dev.
The only outside requirement is Ack and Ctags, I would suggest if you are osx
install them with homebrew.

setup (on osx):

brew install ack
brew install ctags

git clone git@github.com:mgrouchy/vim.git

mv vim .vim
cd .vim

git submodule init
git submodule update

ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

And your good to go.

Any issues or bugs, email me at mgrouchy@gmail.com
